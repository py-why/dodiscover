**dodiscover**
===================

dodiscover is a Python package for representing causal graphs. For example, Acyclic
Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMG), also known as causal DAGs and Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs).
We build on top of ``networkx's`` ``MixedEdgeGraph`` such that we maintain all the well-tested and efficient
algorithms and data structures of ``networkx``.

We encourage you to use the package for your causal inference research and also build on top
with relevant Pull Requests.

See our examples for walk-throughs of how to use the package.

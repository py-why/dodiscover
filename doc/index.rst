**dodiscover**
===================

dodiscover is a Python package for representing causal graphs. For example, Acyclic
Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMG), also known as causal DAGs and Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs).
We build on top of ``networkx's`` ``MixedEdgeGraph`` such that we maintain all the well-tested and efficient
algorithms and data structures of ``networkx``.

We encourage you to use the package for your causal inference research and also build on top
with relevant Pull Requests.

Please refer to our :ref:`user_guide` for details on all the tools that we
provide. You can also find an exhaustive list of the public API in the
:ref:`api_ref`. You can also look at our numerous :ref:`examples <general_examples>`
that illustrate the use of ``dodiscover`` in many different contexts.
